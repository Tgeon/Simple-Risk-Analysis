# Simple-Risk-Analysis

The purpose of this project was to showcase Data Analysis and Visualization that differs from the usual datasets that I work with. This project looks at the penny stock Richtech Robotics and evaluates its risk based on recent data found from Yahoo Finance 2025. This project has a report qmd file with each visualizaton code has a simple analysis based on the trends seen in each visualization. 

This was mostly just a simple project done so that I could use a statistical viewpoint of a stock that I am particularly interested in.
